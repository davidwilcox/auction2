    <h3>Donation Ideas</h3>
    We get homemade food items, from folks who make great homemade
    jam, BBQ sauce, bread, pesto, cakes, pies, fudge, brownies,
    vermouth, beer, mead, etc.
    <br>
    <br> We get high-end household items, paintings, things like
    candlesticks, cameras, high-end children’s room decor and
    games, new or nearly new high-end clothing and boots,. Make
    sure these are things you consider “much better than yard
    sale items”.
    <br>
    <br> We’ve gotten big household items, like a snowblower, a rotary
    push lawn mower, a rooftop car carrier, a deck umbrella—again,
    make sure it’s “much better than yard sale”.
    <br>
    <br> We’ve gotten musical instruments, theater and concert tickets,
    really nice CD & DVD sets.
    <br>
    <br> Ask your favorite restaurant, store or coffee shop if they’ll
    donate a gift certificate. We get gift certificates to restaurants,
    coffee shops, stores, clubs, and special events like the
    Utah Arts Festival.
    <br>
    <br> We’ve had people and families offer a full day of labor,
    to come and plant flower bulbs, babysitting, rides to the
    airport, to set you up with a beehive for a year.
    <br>
    <br> We’ve had tie-dye parties, silk scarf painting parties,
    book-making workshops, craft parties.
    <br>
    <br> We’ve had people contribute their art---paintings, illustrations,
    pottery, quilts, a snarky message done in needlepoint.
    <br>
    <br> We get people offering to share experiences. We’ve had someone
    offer a canyoneering trip, an afternoon on a sailboat, a
    flight in a small plane, hiking with a geologist, dinner
    and a Sundance film, a day of kite flying, a day trip to
    their favorite out-of-the-way town, snow skiing lessons,
    a “banana split and swimming party”, a poker party, a murder
    mystery dinner, bike rides, an african drumming class, an
    Indian cooking class, belly dance lessons, a day of rock
    climbing, and an Academy Awards party hosted by our resident
    professional movie critic. It’d be great to get a backpacking
    trip, a water skiing afternoon, a day fly fishing, a Christmas
    Carol sing-a-long, or a total blow-out kids party!
    <br>
    <br> And we get lots of dinner parties. Offer to host a dinner
    party, featuring some recipe you’re really good at. We’ve
    gotten dinner parties featuring a generations-old spaghetti
    recipe, smoked ribs, authentic Indian food, out-of-the-garden
    veggie lasagne, homemade pizza, homemade beer and brats,
    homemade Mexican food, gourmet vegetarian, dutch oven dinner
    at a cabin up a canyon.
    <br>
    <br> And then we get lots of parties without much of an occasion,
    a wine and cheese party, a backyard BBQ, a morning backyard
    ladies-only brunch, a “Come watch the sunset with tequila
    sunsets” dinner party.
    <br>
    <br> What do you like to do and what would be fun to share…?
